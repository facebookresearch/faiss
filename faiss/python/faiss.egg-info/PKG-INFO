Description: 
        Faiss is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense
        vectors. It contains algorithms that search in sets of vectors of any size,
         up to ones that possibly do not fit in RAM. It also contains supporting
        code for evaluation and parameter tuning. Faiss is written in C++ with
        complete wrappers for Python/numpy. Some of the most useful algorithms
        are implemented on the GPU. It is developed by Facebook AI Research.
