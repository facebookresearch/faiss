 * Throughout the library, vectors are provided as float * pointers.
 * Most algorithms can be optimized when several vectors are processed
 * (added/searched) together in a batch. In this case, they are passed
 * in as a matrix. When n vectors of size d are provided as float * x,
 * component j of vector i is
 *
 *   x[ i * d + j ]
 *
 * where 0 <= i < n and 0 <= j < d. In other words, matrices are
 * always compact. When specifying the size of the matrix, we call it
 * an n*d matrix, which implies a row-major storage.
